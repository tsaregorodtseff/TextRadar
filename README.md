Embedded fuzzy search technology for various systems, such as websites, accounting systems, databases, etc.

A fuzzy search in the text is an urgent task if it is necessary to find information on some fragments of lines and it is not known in advance in what combinations these fragments can occur in the text.

The principle of operation of the TextRadar algorithm is based on the correlation analysis in its interpretation as applied to text data. The algorithm is original and is not a compilation of any of the well-known methods of fuzzy string comparisons.
